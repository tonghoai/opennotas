### Contributing guide

OpenNotas was created in just over a month to meet the author's need for a cross-platform note-taking app. You can review it in the article: [Creating a Note-taking App - Notas](https://2coffee.dev/en/articles/note-taking-app-notas).

As a full-time programmer and programming tutorial blogger, I have a lot on my plate. Due to time constraints, I kindly request that you **temporarily refrain from submitting Pull requests for new features** or **expect delays in response to Pull requests**. If you wish to make modifications or add new features, please clone the source code and build it for yourself. Thank you for your understanding!
